    items: [
      [
        'Is this therapy?',
        'No. Members frequently find it therapeutic, which is not the same thing. Cohort Learning Labs provides facilitated learning and group inquiry, not psychotherapy, crisis services or mental-health treatment. If you are in acute distress, this is not the right room, and Elie will say so in the consultation.',
      ],
      [
        'Is it a course?',
        'No. There is no syllabus and nothing to complete. The group agrees on one relationship to examine, and then studies its own reactions to it. Your material is the hour you are in.',
      ],
      [
        'Is it religious?',
        'No. The line from Pirkei Avot on these pages describes how the room is run — a bashful person cannot learn, an impatient person cannot teach. Groups are mixed, and no text is treated as authoritative.',
      ],
      [
        'What does “stimulus” mean?',
        'Whatever the cohort agrees to react to. It arrives as a text, a topic or a skill, and it is always about a relationship: a marriage, a parent and a child, an employee and an employer. Your reactions to it, and to each other, become the curriculum.',
      ],
    ],

  {
    label: '02 — Being in the room',
    items: [
      [
        'What if I find it difficult to speak?',
        'You do not need to arrive ready to disclose personal things. Listening, noticing a reaction, or saying that you are finding it difficult to speak can be a beginning. Elie helps the group make room for participation without forcing it. Four sessions offer a first experience of this practice, not a promise that a longstanding pattern will disappear.',
      ],
      [
        'What if I talk too much?',
        'You will hear about it, in specifics, from people with no reason to flatter you. That is one of the more valuable hours available to a person who is used to being the quickest in the room.',
      ],
      [
        'What if I dislike someone in the group?',
        'Say so, in the room, to them. That is not a breach of the method; it is the method. What you do with the person you find difficult is the most useful thing you will learn there.',
      ],
      [
        'Who else is in it?',
        'In an open cohort, six to eight people who do not share an employer, a history or a stake in each other’s next promotion. Elie composes each group after speaking with everyone in it.',
      ],
      [
        'Is it confidential?',
        'Yes, and it is the one rule with no flexibility in it. What is said in the group stays in the group. Sessions are not recorded, and no notes leave the room.',
      ],
    ],
  },
  {
    label: '03 — Practicalities',
    items: [
      [
        'How long is the commitment?',
        'Four weekly sessions, ninety minutes each, at the same time. This gives the group time to return to what happened, notice patterns, and experience the work over more than one conversation.',
      ],
      [
        'What if I miss a week?',
        'Tell the group in advance. An absence affects the other members, so it belongs to the room rather than to your calendar alone. Repeated absence changes what the group can do, and Elie will raise it.',
      ],
      [
        'What does it cost?',
        `Open cohorts cost ${OPEN_COHORT_PRICE} per member for all four 90-minute sessions. This is a one-time package price. Private groups are quoted after a conversation about scope.`,
      ],
      [
        'Can I bring my own team?',
        'Yes, as a private group. The differences in an intact team are live and the consequences real, which makes the work different from an open cohort — more careful, and often more consequential. Say so when you book the consultation.',
      ],
      [
        'Is there an application?',
        'Pick an open time on the consultation calendar, then thirty minutes with Elie. Not everyone is placed. Composition matters more here than filling a seat, and being turned down is usually about the fit of a particular group rather than about you.',
